# Sprint Challenge: Predict Steph Curry's Shots 🏀

Use a dataset with all Steph Curry's NBA field goal attempts from October 2009 through June 2019 (regular season and playoffs). 
The dataset was collected with the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) Python library.

Create a model to predict whether Curry will make a shot based on his past perfomance.
